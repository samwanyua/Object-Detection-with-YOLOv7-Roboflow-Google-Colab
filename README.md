# Construction Helmet Detection using YOLOv7 

This project involves training an object detection model to identify **construction helmets** using **YOLOv7**, with data preprocessing and annotation powered by **Roboflow**, and training executed on **Google Colab** with **PyTorch**.

---

##  Project Overview

Ensuring safety at construction sites is crucial, and detecting whether workers are wearing helmets can be automated using computer vision. This project leverages **YOLOv7**, one of the most accurate real-time object detectors, to train a helmet detection model.

###  Objectives
- Detect presence of construction helmets in real-time.
- Improve safety compliance using automated systems.
